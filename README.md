## Binder
Binder is a way to run Jupyter files from the web. For this class it is preferred that you download Anaconda and use Jupyter Lab to open these files from your own computer. To Review these files and play with Jupyter a bit you are welcome to use this link to open the first lab. Note it may take a while to load.
