    "This semester you will learn about how to model a physical system as computer code.  You will also learn the basics of error analysis. The things we will study could be applied to many physical systems, but for this class we will focus on modeling projectile motion.  The programing language we will use is called Python.  Python is a great first language, and once you learn one language you will find it is much easier to learn others.\n",

These documents will be turned in each week to show the work you have done. In these notebooks I expect good writing.  That means, among other things, that there are clear explanations of equations and plots.  Also that there are smooth transitions from one idea to another.  This document is written in Jupyter and serves as an example of what I expect."

    "## Jupyter Introduction\n",
    "Jupyter is a platform for creating documents that include programming code.  Text is entered into boxes, or cells. There are basically two different types of cells we will use most, Code cells and Markdown cells.  The type of cell you are currently working on can be changed by changing a the value of a drop down menu at top of the page.  If you don't yet have Jupyter installed on your computer please install it from [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).  You can also try it out without installing it [here](https://tmp54.tmpnb.org/user/FMH5HhFlGmUa/notebooks/Welcome%20to%20Python.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are for entering programming code.  These cells have a In[] with a number in the brackets. The code is run when the cursor is in the cell and you press \"Shift\" and \"Enter\" at the same time. We will be using Code cells to run Python code, but there are many different languages that could be used in these cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are for entering text, or other informative material.  The text can include formating information, or other marks that show what should be displayed.  For example headers are markdown cells that start with the '#' symbol. HTML and LaTex can also be entered.  We will make use of LaTex a great deal this semester. LaTex code is a way to make mathematical symbols and equations.  To start and end a LaTex portion within a cell you use the dollar symbol (<b>$</b>) or two dollar symbols (<b>$$</b>).  Try it each and see the difference it makes.  All kinds of mathematics can be expressed this way.  For example $$\\int e^{i \\pi} \\cos\\left[\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}x\\right] dx$$ A short list of a number of other things you can do in the markdown cells is given in this [totoral](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/twistedhardware/mltutorial/blob/master/notebooks/jupyter/2.%20Markdown%20%26%20LaTeX.ipynb#).\n",

These could have values of any number between negative infinity and infinity in addition they may have an infinite number of values between any two other values. A computer has a hard time with that level of ambiguity.  In writing code we need to assign a specific value (or maybe a list of values) for each variable.
